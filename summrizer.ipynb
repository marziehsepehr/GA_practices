Memories of McKinsey 175 INDEX 179 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Icould not have written this book without the help, input, and support of many others . thanks to my editor, Mary Glenn, and all the team at McGraw-Hill Professional Book Group for believing in this pro­ject . much appreciation goes to Simon Carne, especially for his help with the section on MECE . many thanks as well to Adam Gold for pushing my thinking dur­ing the early stages of this book . they are Kristin Asleson, Abe Bleiberg, Gresh Brebach, Tom Burke, Eric Hartz, Jason Klein, Hamish McDermott (you know who you are), Seth Radwell, Jeff Sakaguchi, Drew Smith, Suzanne Tosini . McKinsey & Company has become the world’s most successful strategic consulting firm . since its founding in 1923, the firm has become a leader in strategic consulting . it currently has 75 offices (and counting) around the world and employs 4500 professionals . it consults to most of the Fortune 100, as well as to many U.S. state and federal agencies and foreign governments . several senior McKinsey partners have risen to international prominence in their own right . Lowell Bryan advised the Senate Banking Committee during the savings and loan crisis . Kenichi Ohmae recently left the Firm . McKinsey’s “alumni” have gone on to senior positions around the world . the Firm seeks out the cream of each year’s crop of business school graduates . the Firm demands total devotion to client service, submission to grueling schedule . promotion can be rapid for those who meet McKinsey’s standards . the firm has a powerful corpo­ rate culture based on shared values and common experiences . every McKinsey-ite goes through the same rigorous training programs . McKinsey has its own jargon too . it is full of acronyms: EM, ED, DCS, ITP, ELT, BPR . McKinsey-ites call assign­ments or projects “engagements” on engagements . introduction xiii of it, once understood, can be as useful to business­people outside the Firm as it is . a team will search for the “key drivers” in their quest to add value . ABOUT THIS BOOK I have divided this book into five parts . in the first three, I explain how McKinsey-ites think about business problems . in Part Four, I give some lessons McKinsey-ites have learned for coping with the stresses of life at the Firm . I wrote this book with the goal of communicating new and use­ ful skills to everyone who wants to be more efficient in business . this book will give any executive who works with management consultants, whether from McKinsey or elsewhere, some insight into how these strange beings think . the root of all management consulting is the application of objec­xiv Introduction tive analysis by dispassionate outsiders . based this book on my own experience as a McKinsey associ­ ate from 1989 to 1992 . ABOUT CLIENTS The word client appears in almost every chapter of this book . I interviewed dozens of former associates, engagement managers, and partners of the firm . client means the organization for which you are solving a business problem . if you are not a consultant of some form, you don’t have a client . the term client becomes applicable to any organization in which you work . a former McKinsey-ite agreed never to disclose confidential information . the firm guards its secrets closely . I do XV Introduction not intend to break that agreement. this book can be read from start to finish or dipped into like a box of chocolates . the MCKINSEY WAY This page intentionally left blank . the con­ sultants who succeed at McKinsey love to solve prob­ lems . a part of you is always asking, why is some­thing done this way? part one describes how McKinsey thinks about business problems . it shows what it means to be fact­ based, structured, and hypothesis-driven . /orn11*Engagement manager. team members meet for the first time to discuss their client’s problem . they know that their solution will be Fact-based, Rigidly structured and hypothesis-driven . the true McKinsey hierarchy for consultants is in descending order: client, Firm, you . 3 4 Thinking About Business Problems FACTS ARE FRIENDLY Facts are the bricks with which you will lay a path to your solution and build pillars to support it. all members of the team comb through stacks of articles and internal research documents to gather enough facts to illuminate their piece of the problem . the team then races to gather the facts necessary (when put through the appropriate analyses) to support or refute it. gathering and analyz­ing facts is your raison d’étre at McKinsey . it comes down to very careful, high-quality analysis of the components of the problem combined with an aggressive attitude toward fact gathering . most McKinsey-ites are generalists . they know a little about a lot of things . but they will still know less about inventory *Senior engagement manager . the SEM is in charge of mul­ tiple studies and is expected to take a hand in client relations . SEMs get all the stress of partnership with less pay than the folks who have been running the distribution operations of Stop & Shop for the last 10 years . the typical associate* (at least in the united states) will have graduated near the top of her college class . she will have spent two or three years working for a large company . she may have to present her analysis to the CEO of a Fortune 50 company . this is just as true for a junior executive presenting a proposal to his boss . if they look too closely at the facts, they might not like what they see . but they won't fear the facts . you must not fear them . MECE stands for “mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive” and it is a sine qua non of the problem-solving process at McKinsey . MECE gets pounded into every new associate’s head from the moment of entering the Firm . every document (including internal memos), every presentation, every e-mail and voice mail produced by a McKinsey-ite is supposed to be MECE . if you think you have determined the issues, take a hard look at them . if so, then your issues are collectively exhaustive . Suppose your team is working on a study for the famous american manufacturing firm Acme Widgets . your team might come up with a list of the following ways to increase widget sales . Suppose you add another item, say, “Reengineering our widget production process.” How does that fit with the three issues you already have? putting any (or all) of them with the other three issues on the list would cause an overlap . overlap represents muddled thinking by the writer and leads to confusion . one of your team members says, \"we should think about ways to improve widget quality through the produc­tion process\" if you have a list in which all the items are separate and distinct, check that it also includes every issue or item relevant to the problem . you should refine your list to include, under \"Reducing unit cost,\" the sub­ issue \"Reengineering the production process to reduce unit cost\" and under \"Improving the way we market . Suppose your team has come up with some interesting ideas that don’t fit under the main issues . you could ignore those points, but that wouldn’t help Acme. a good McKinsey issue list contains neither fewer than two nor more than five top-line issues . there is a solution to this dilemma—the magical category “Other Issues” . Try a little harder to fit those brilliant ideas into your top-line issues . if all else fails, Other Issues will help you stay MECE . the initial hypothesis (IH) is the third pillar of the McKinsey prob- lem-solving process . Suppose you have to drive to a restaurant in a part of town you don’t know . you know how to get to Smith Street; you’ll just follow your directions . the initial hypothesis works the same way . if your IH is correct, then solving the problem means filling in the details . we can increase widget sales by: Changing the way we sell our widgets to retail outlets . reducing the unit cost of the widgets . a hypothesis is merely a theory to be proved 10 Thinking About Business Problems or disproved . a few months down the road, it will be the first slide in your presenta­tion . if it turns out to be wrong, you will have enough information to move toward the right answer . by putting your IH down on paper, and determining how you can prove or disprove it, you have set up a road map . former McKinsey SEM had a good approach for generating IHs . I would sit down with the trade publications in that industry for an hour or two . you don’t need all the facts, just enough to have a good overview of the industry and the problem . if the problem is in your own business, you may already have the facts in your head. Suppose your business’s 11 Building the Solution profits are greatly affected by the weather . make an actionable recommendation regarding each driver . \"we must reduce our vulnerability to changes in the weather\" is an actionable, top-line recommendation . consider the likely answers to each issue, then go down another level . you should get a good sense of what is provable and what is not . in the Acme Widgets problem, suppose your team decided that the key drivers were the sales force, the consumer marketing strategy, and production costs . you came up with a list of action­ able, top-line recommendations as your initial hypothesis . we can increase widget sales by: Changing the way we sell our widgets to retail outlets . superstores, department stores, and specialty stores sell pri­marily to three types of retail outlets . the team believes that the sales force should be organized by customer type . the issue tree is what McKinsey calls the problem tree . the result looks like the figure below . if they were put in charge of all superstores across the country and achieved the same penetration . when you’ve completed your issue tree, you have your map . the difficult part will come when you have to dig deep to prove your hypothesis . ISSUE TREE FOR ACME WIDGETS Sales Force Organization Change Sales Force Sales Skill Base Strategy Promotion Strategy Product Quality Improve Widget Increase Marketing Packaging Sales Strategy Raw Materials Sourcing Reduce Production Process Unit Cost Distribution System 13 Building the Solution TESTING THE INITIAL HYPOTHESIS Before you take your problem-solving map out on the road, you want (forgive the mixed metaphor) to kick the tires on it. Is it the best possible hypothesis you could devise, given what you know about the industry and your client or company? Have you considered all the drivers of the problem? Are all your recommendations actionable and provable? IHs produced by teams are much stronger than those produced by individuals . most of us are poor critics of our own thinking. we need others to pick apart our ideas . everyone should have his or her own ideas and initial hypotheses . if you are the team leader, you should try to be the thought leader too . this page intentionally left blank . if you know the essence of the McKinsey problem-solving process, you can now conquer the business world . in this chapter, I will explain how McKinsey-ites approach business problems . you must figure out how to approach each problem in order to devise the best solution for it . business problem solving is organic and complex, like medicine . a patient will come into a doctor’s office and say that he thinks he has the flu . the doctor will not immedi­ately trust the patient's conclusion . she will take the patient’s history, ask some probing questions, and then make her diagnosis . a team went in to evaluate expansion opportunities for a division of a manufacturing company . the division needed not expansion; it was closure or sell-off . the only way to figure out if the problem you have been given is to dig deeper . get facts. Ask questions. Poke around . it usually does not take very long to figure if you are heading down the right path . a doctor will tell a patient, \"Mr. Jones, I can treat your headache, but I think it’s a symptom of something more serious and I’d like to do further tests\" in the same way, you should go back to your client, or your boss, who-ever it was that asked for your input in the first place . the client can either accept your recommendation or tell you to stay on the original problem, but you will have fulfilled your responsibility to act in the client’s best interests . most business problems resemble each other more than they differ . problem-solving techniques may be written down or in the heads of your fellow employees . if not, use your experience to develop your own tool kit. McKinsey, like every other consulting firm, has developed a num­ ber of problem-solving methods . they allow consultants very rapidly to fit raw data that lands on their desks into a coherent framework . the consultants can focus their thinking on the “drivers” of the problem . the technique involves identifying the client’s suppliers, customers, competitors, and possible substitute products . what impact could these have on our client? which factors could actually cause major changes to the way the client designs, manufactures, distributes, sells, and services its products? this framework will help you build a snapshot of your competitive environment . these frameworks really help at the start of the problem-solving process . all executives at the bank wanted IT reorganized, but not if it meant changes in the way their computers were supported . for­19 Developing an Approach tunately , the Firm had recently developed a new paradigm, called Business Process Redesign . the firm was still coming to grips with BPR . BPR helped the client force through the reorganization . if we had not had at least a starting framework, we might never have left the ground . the firm bases its solutions on the most current management fad . critics of the firm say this is untrue . a former SEM at McKinsey puts it like this: people think that the Firm—and management consultants in general—have a precanned answer . if it were, then the Firm would not be as successful as it is . in 8 out of 10 pricing problems the answer turns out to be “raise your prices” . in fact-based analysis, firms should be rais­ing their prices . if you automatically say that’s the answer, you’ll get into trouble . be careful about blindly trusting your gut, as you gain experience in business . McKinsey alumnus is a merchant banker . but most executives aren’t that good . a sharp manager with a lot of business experience can often reach the same conclusions . Developing an Approach DON’T MAKE THE FACTS FIT YOUR SOLUTION Avoid the temptation to view your initial hypothesis as the answer and the problem-solving process as an exercise in proving the IH. the EM assured his team and the client that the key to restoring the client’s profitability was eliminating “leakage” . he assigned a new associate to determine the rate of leakage in fire insurance claims over the pre­vious three years. he combed through stacks of claims in search of leakage . the EM simply told the young associate to look again, this time in auto insurance . the EM was sitting in the team’s on-site HQ looking slightly despondent . the client poked his head around the doorpost . you must always be prepared to accept that the facts may prove 22 Thinking About Business Problems you wrong . don’ t try to pound them into your framework like square pegs into round holes. how does the new informa­tion fit into your hypothesis? Doing these little reality checks now and then could save you from chasing down blind alleys . rep­ resents the exception rather than the rule at McKinsey, at least in my experience . EM has long since left the Firm . a former McKinsey EM who now works on wall street tells this story . they were in the midst of linking all their offices by satellite . this project had begun several years 23 Developing an Approach . we determined that with currently available technology they could do the same thing for a fraction of the cost using conventional phone lines . by our calculations, they would have saved $170 million on a present value basis . at one level, it’s unbelievable that he didn’t accept our idea . on another level, we were coming up with other suggestions that would save the organization half a billion . McKinsey hires people with stellar academic records and enforces a rigorous discipline in analyzing problems and structuring solutions . a new hire’s first instinct is to go hell for leather after the very best solution . businesses are full of real people, with real strengths and weaknesses and limitations . some things they just cannot do, whether for polit­ical reasons or lack of resources . if your client is your own employer—or your own business—that responsibility is doubled . the rules of problem solving, like all rules, have their exceptions . the scope of your project will be so large that starting with an IH will be worthless . other times, you will be breaking new ground and nothing in your experience will point to a solution . former EM at the Firm recounts how the back-office processing worked . he was on a study where we were trying to improve the per­formance of the foreign exchange business of a major bank . the woman in charge of back-office processing was interviewed . she said: \"you know nothing about this business. one of two things is going to happen. either you'll come back with something we don’t agree with, which will necessarily be wrong, or you’ll listen to us . she gave us the data we asked for, in which case you added no value . it turned out that one product, which represented about 5 percent of their business, was producing about 50% of their costs . they had no idea this was going on . any McKinsey-ite will tell you that no business problem is immune to the power of fact-based analysis . put together enough facts, combine them with creative thinking, and you will come up with a solution . unofficial mentor asked me to work with him on what promised to be a fun and exciting study . the client, a major financial institution in the midst of reorganizing its investment management business, faced severe challenges of heroic dimen­ sions . the result left a bad taste in our mouths . factions within the client’s senior management pre­vented us from doing our job . the road of problem solving is often strewn with obstacles . sometimes businesses realize too late that they have a problem . by the time McKinsey addresses the problem, the business is already doomed . the biggest obstacle—the troll guarding the bridge—is politics . 27 Developing an approach The first thing to understand about politics is that businesses are full of real people . former McKinsey EM says change management means changing management . some at the client will welcome the bringers of change as white knights riding to the rescue . others will see the team as an invading army to either flee or drive out . former McKinsey-ite says it was a rare engagement when there wasn't at least one sector of the client organization that didn't want us there . in most cases, enough players in the organization will cooperate willingly and can be effective . you have several options to choose from when confronted by a problem that seems too difficult to solve . you can tell your client that the prob­lem is not X, it’s Y. Tweak your way to a solution that you know the client organization can’t implement . if you make this switch very early on, you show great business judgment . as people leave the organization, you can “tweak” your way to your optimum over time. work through the politics. even political problems are solu­ ble. politics is just people acting in their own interests . to work through the politics, you must think about how your solution affects the players in an organization . consensus building may require you to change your solution to make it acceptable . remember that politics is the art of the possi­ble and it’s no good devising the ideal solution if the client refuses to accept it . this chapter contains a number of rules that McKinsey con­ sultants have found useful when trying to solve problems . they are difficult to classify; call them my “Other Issues.” Click here for Terms of Use . 20 percent of a secretary’s job will take up 80 percent of her time . if you keep your eyes peeled for examples, you will come up with ways to improve it . in my first-ever study, I saw the 80/20 rule at work all the time at McKinsey . the board wanted to show them how to improve the profitability of their institutional equity brokerage business . the first thing McKinsey does is take a step back and ask the ques­tion “Where do your profits come from?” the answer is not always obvious, even to people who have been in their particular business for years . 31 80/20 and Other Rules to Live By analyzed data from every angle . 80 percent of sales came from 20 percent of the brokers . 80% of orders came from 20% of the customers . 80% of the sales staff is lazy or incompetent . our client’s three top brokers handled the 10 biggest accounts . 80/20 gives us a jump-start in solving the client's problem . what are your sales figures by product? how does each member of your sales team perform? if you know your business well, put it on a spreadsheet or in a database . you will begin to see patterns, clumps that stand out . think about business problems DON’T BOIL THE OCEAN Work smarter, not harder . there’s a lot of data out there relating to your problem . McKinsey gathers enough facts to prove a hypothe­ sis or support or refute an analysis . this is the flip side of fact-based analysis in a business situa­tion . my EM, Vik, asked how my work was going . he picked up my draft, leafed through it, and said, \"ethan, it’s eleven o’clock. The client will love this. Call it a day. Don’t boil the ocean\" 33 80/20 and Other Rules to Live By FIND THE KEY DRIVERS Many factors affect your business . focus on the most impor tant ones—the key drivers . the three most important factors are X, Y, and Z . engineers learn something called the Square Law of Compu­ tation . for every component of a system, the amount of computation required to solve the system increases at least as fast as the square of the number of equations . if the complexity of your problem doubles, the time it takes to solve it quadruples . astronomers start by ignoring most of these objects . focusing on the key drivers means drilling down to the core of the problem, rather than picking the whole problem apart piece by piece . Gerald M. Weinberg, an introduction to general systems thinking . it saves time, saves you effort. it keeps you from boil­ing the ocean . the ELEV ATOR TEST Know your solution (or your product or business) so thor oughly that you can explain it clearly and precisely to your client (or customer or investor) in 30 seconds . imagine it’s time for that big, end-of-engagement presentation . senior executives of your Fortune 50 client are taking their places around the boardroom table on the top floor of the corporate skyscraper . the CEO strides into the room and says, \"sorry, folks. I can’t stay. the ride will take about 30 seconds . can you tell the CEO your solution? Can you sell him your solution . that’s the elevator test . many companies use the elevator test (or something similar) because it’s an excellent way of making sure that their executives’ *A McKinsey presentation document so called is bound with blue cardboard covers . a producer will tell a writer to \"give me the bullet\" on a new script . if the producer likes what she’s heard, the writer will get a chance to talk further . how do you encapsulate six months’ work in 30 seconds? start with the issues your team addressed . stick to the three most important—the ones with the biggest payoffs . analysis shows that a manufacturing client can’t sell enough widgets because its sales force is organized by ter­ritory when it should be organized by buyer category . analysis of salespeople by buyer type, buyer interviews, field visits to retail and wholesale outlets, and so forth. 36 Thinking About Business Problems PLUCK THE LOW-HANGING FRUIT Sometimes in the middle of the problem-solving process, opportunities arise to get an easy win, to make immediate improvements . McKinsey consultants put this doctrine into practice . clients can get impatient for a result during the six months that a big engagement can last . we wanted to communicate our findings to the senior man­ agers of the institutional equities department . we set up a meeting with the department head and the heads of all the business units in the division: sales, trading, research . the client had no idea how inefficient its operation was . the presentation convinced those executives who had not been particularly keen on McKin- sey’s presence that they had a problem . before meeting, I was a smart-ass MBA poking around their business . by plucking the low-hanging fruit, by resisting the temptation to hoard our information until some big end-of-study presentation . if you are on a software design project with a three-month lead time, show it to your boss . solve only part of a problem can still mean increased profits . MAKE A CHART EVERY DAY During the problem-solving process, you learn something new every day . it will help you push your thinking, but once you have crystalized it on the page, you won’t forget it . a typical day at McKinsey, you could start with a brainstorming session at 9 a.m., move on to a client inter­ view at 10, a factory tour at 11, and then a sandwich lunch with your director . you can avoid this by sitting down for half an hour at the end of the day and asking yourself, \"What are the three most impor­ tant things I learned today?\" Put them down in a chart or two— nothing fancy; neatness doesn’t count. if the facts don’t lend themselves to charting, just write them down as bullet points . put your results someplace where they won’t get lost—don’t just toss them into your in-tray . one EM from germany would write a whole presentation every night . he should have followed some of the suggestions presented in Part Four . the office held a retreat at a resort upstate . the speaker was the CEO of a major electronics company and a client of the Firm . McKinsey associates have spent their whole lives \"knocking it out of the park\" they all have first-class academic backgrounds combined with records of achievement in other fields . it took several years of gaining perspective before I understood the wisdom of the CEO’s words . he was right: it’s impossible to do everything yourself all the time . the prin­ ciple applies as much to senior managers as to junior executives whose MBA diplomas are still wet with ink . most people have the brainpower and energy to be a one-man show all the time . if you manage it once, you raise unrealistic expectations from those around you . once you fail to meet expectations, it is very difficult to regain credibility . a high-flying company that posts 20 percent profit increases every year sees its stock price soar . the company has a reputation as a leader in the e-commerce industry . wall Street drops the stock like a hot potato and its share price plummets . when it gets back on the growth track, several years can go by before investors trust it enough to pile back in. each player came on a circle of 41 80/20 and Other Rules to Live By . the size of each section depended on the player’s career record . it’s OK for Mark McGwire to strike out a lot, as long as he keeps hitting those home runs . the home run kings like Ruth, DiMaggio, and Aaron had the biggest strikeout zones . LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE Every now and then, take a mental step back from whatever you’re doing . ask yourself some basic questions: How does what you're doing solve the problem? why are you doing it? analysis B follows analysis A and seems in turn to be followed seamlessly by analysis C . new data comes in and points to yet more analyses with which to fill your days (and nights) if you’re feeling swamped by it all, take a metaphorical step back and figure out what it is you're trying to achieve . do 42 Thinking About Business Problems this by looking at the big picture . figure out your priorities; you can do only so much in a day . there is nothing quite so frustrating as looking back over the course of a week . but what you have come up with is worthless . the firm pounds the concept of professional integrity into its associates from their first day on the job . a former McKinsey EM tells me, \"does this really matter?' it was the morning of an important progress meeting at our client, a Fortune 50 manufacturing company . the team and our ED were going over the various sections of the presentation . the ED is in charge of a study, and most EDs head up several studies at one time . 43 80/20 and Other Rules to Live By had already been through my piece of it . years of Ivy League and business school reflexes took over . I came out with a few lines of general agreement . if I had told John, \"I'm not really sure—I haven’t looked at this issue before,\" I would have been fine . even if he had said, \"Sorry, I just lost it for a minute,\" he would have understood . the EM presented each of the team members with presents of a rude and/or humorous nature . for my gift, he handed me a little desktop picture frame around the following words, neatly printed in the official font . 44 Thinking About Business Problems DON’T ACCEPT “I HA VE NO IDEA” People always have an idea if you probe just a bit . ask a few pointed questions and they tell you, “I have no idea” don’t just walk away in defeat. “I have no idea” is a code; it really means, “I’m too busy to take the time to think about this,” or “I don’t think I’m smart enough to know about these things” . Jason Klein was sure his top competitor was outspending him by a factor of 10 . he told his team to put together a P&L (profit and loss statement) for the competitor . 45 80/20 and Other Rules to Live By put together a pretty comprehensive P&L backed up by solid assumptions . they could make an educated guess of the com-petitor’s cost per issue . you shouldn’t accept “I have no idea” from others, so don’t expect others to accept it from you . this is the flip side of a business decision . this page intentionally left blank . in part one, we looked at the way McKinsey thinks about business problems and uses fact-based, hypothe- sis-driven, structured analysis . the goal is for you to experience what it’s like to participate in a typical McKinsey study . it will take you six months of working until 1 a.m. McKinsey-ite will tell you that the Firm doesn’t sell . Getting your foot through the door is only half the battle when marketing your skills as a problem solver . we will look at the Zen of McKinsey salesmanship and learn how to trim a problem-solving project to a manageable size and scope . 49 50 Working to Solve Business problems HOW TO SELL WITHOUT SELLING Business problems are like mice. peo­ ple who don’t have mice won’t be interested—until the mice show up; then they need to know you have the mousetrap . some times the right way to sell your product or service is not to barge into your customer’s home with a bunch of free sam­ples . he told me he had a \"beauty parade\" for a prospective client the next morning . \"good luck,\" he replied as I left . this curi­ous aspect of McKinsey’s culture stems from the roots of the Firm’s founders in “white shoe” law and accounting firms . in those days, it was considered beneath the dignity of pro­fessional service firms to advertise or solicit business . McKinsey does not run ads in Forbes or Barron’s advertis­ ing 50 percent off telecommunications consulting . a partner’s compensation depends in large part on the amount of business he brings to the Firm . the firm waits for the phone to ring, and ring it does, not because McKinsey sells . the Firm produces a steady stream of books and articles, some of them extremely influential . it also publishes its own scholarly journal, The McKinsey Quarterly . many partners and directors are internationally known as experts in their fields . examples are low­ell Bryan, who has advised congressional banking committees . Kenichi Ohmae recently left the firm . the Firm encourages its partners to par­ticipate in “extracurricular activities” such as sitting on the boards of charities, museums, and cultural organizations . many members of these boards are executives at current or potential clients . working to Solve Business Problems Occasional meetings with former clients allow partners to check up on effects of past projects . these efforts could not be construed as selling, but they make sure that the right people know the Firm is there . you may not be on the same charitable board as billionaire investor Warren Buffett . trade shows, conferences, even the right bars will give you the chance to make sure they know who you are . today's competitor could change jobs and become tomorrow's customer . make sure your name is the one your customers think of when they have a need you can fill . don’t bite off more than you can chew . set definite milestones that you can achieve . when clients come to McKinsey with a problem, they want it fixed yesterday and for nothing . most clients realize that this desire is just slightly unrealistic . the ED stands between the client and its demands on one side . if the client is structuring an engagement, McKinsey faces a lot of pressure . the team can be pushed only so far for so long before the quality of its work begins to decline . the challenge for the ED is to balance the desires and budget constraints of the client with the limits of the team. a team of four to six consultants can com- *Director of client services . the DCS is the highest rung of the McKinsey hierarchy . as the Firm spends time within a client organization, it almost always uncovers new problems that could benefit from McKinsey’s expertise . however, these problems must be addressed at another time and in another engagement . as long as the client is happy with the results that the Firm produces, it is likely to have a stream of new business . the best EDs can balance the competing demands of client and team to a nicety . they tell the client, \"We’re going to do X and Y. EDs have reputations for overpromising to the client and putting their teams through hell . they then work the team to its limit while simul­taneously making the client feel that he is getting value for money and exceeding his expectations . EDs were vague about the exact nature of the end product of a study . they left the team to figure out just what it was supposed to do . the answer is simple: don’t bite off more than you (and your team) can chew . the 55 Selling a Study lesson for you is a bit more complicated . don’ t blithely accept the assignment and say, “Sure, boss” . figure out what the end product of each chunk will be: a recommendation, an implementation plan, a new product design, and so forth . a few months down the road can save you a lot of grief . this page intentionally left blank . 5 ASSEMBLING A TEAM ABOUT TEAMS At McKinsey, you never walk alone . the smallest team I ever worked on consisted of me and my EM on a pro bono engagement for a new york theater company . at the other end of the scale, the Firm’s largest clients might have sev­ eral five- or six-person teams working on site at one time . com­ plexity of these problems makes it impossible for one per son to solve them . more people mean more hands to gather and analyze data and, more important, more minds to figure out what the data really mean . 57 58 Working to Solve Business Problems The Firm has developed a number of strategies for putting together and maintaining high-performance teams . 59 Assembling a T eam GETTING THE MIX RIGHT You can’t just throw four random people at a problem and expect them to solve it . choose your team carefully, getting the best mix of people from the resources you have available . EMs and EDs must learn the art of team selection . their experiences can help you, even if you can’t call on on the same level of resources . the first theory states that intellectual horsepower is every-thing . the second theory says that what really matters is specific experience and skills . neither of these theories is completely correct, but neither of them is completely wrong . team selection varies from problem to problem and client to client . if you have complex data you need to decipher, then you want the two or three best number crunchers that you can find, regardless of whether they can simultaneously walk and chew gum. the EM and ED pick associates from the pool of resources at the time . if an engagement begins, the ED and EM pick their associates . the biggest mistake in team selection comes from taking those ratings at face value . a smart EM always talks to potential team members before taking them on . if you are in a position to pick your team mem­ bers before embarking on a project, never just accept people who are supposed to be good . talk to them; see what’s behind the recommendations . maybe in her last assign­ment Sally just got lucky . 61 Assembling a T eam A LITTLE TEAM BONDING GOES A LONG W AY It’s a truism that a team will perform better . a team leader should make an effort to promote team bonding . make sure it doesn't become a chore . one ED even took his whole team to Florida for a long weekend . former sEM abe Bleiberg put it like this: \"i’m not sure that team bonding is all that important\" a team works together well, and that will come or not over the course of a project. team bonding is not, “did you take your team to enough dinners? Did you go to the circus?” Most people, even very hard-working people, want to have a life . working to solve business problems If a team is going to bond, it will mostly bond through work. a typical team works at the client for 10 to 14 hours a day . that’s plenty of time for bonding . on an out-of-town study, team members will eat dinner together more often . a former associate noted that the best team dinners were at lunch . the EM knew the associates had lives . maintain your team’s morale is an on-going responsibility . 63 Assembling a T eam After the other, I was ready to leave the Firm . the team became a football kicked between rival factions at the client . my “bad” EM (who shall remain nameless) managed by the Mushroom Method: \"Cover them with manure and keep them in the dark\" I never got a sense that what I was doing was valuable, either to the team or to the client. we knew about the client politics—we understood it— and that made it easier for us to work with it . there isn’t one—just a few simple rules to remember . take your team’s temperature. Talk to your teammates. Make sure they are happy with what they are doing . if you change your mind all the time about the team’s priorities or the analyses you’re doing, your team will quickly become confused and demoralized . if you need to make a big change, let your team know, explain why, and let people contribute to, or at least see, your thought process . people want to feel that what they are doing is adding value to the client . the Firm val­ ues most in its EDs . respect doesn’t just mean politeness, it’s completely unprofessional . it means remembering that your teammates may have different priorities than you do . you may like to work until midnight six days a week, but your team may have better things . respect also means never asking one to do something you wouldn’t do or haven’t done yourself . share a bit about yourself as well; that makes it more likely that your teammates will think of you as part of “us” rather than “them” if you follow the rules on maintaining morale, at least your team won’t feel like resigning when it’s all over . the problem is difficult; the client is difficult . COMMAND McKinsey has a split personality when it comes to hierarchy . on the one hand, the Firm claims it has no real hierarchy, on the other hand . the directors and, to a lesser extent, the partners make decisions about the direction of the Firm . the EMs, associates, analysts, and support staff live with them . if I disagreed with my ED over an issue, his opinion won out . McKinsey has another, unofficial hierarchy: one based on experience and credentials . EMs had associates clamoring to work for them and everyone sought out the best EDs and DCSs as mentors and career makers . each organization has its own approach to hierarchy . 67 Managing Hierarchy MAKE YOUR BOSS LOOK GOOD If you make your boss look good, your boss will make you look good. that’s the quid pro quo of hierarchy. my EM got the job instead, but I understood the rationale behind the decision . the next day, he delivered the presentation very convincingly . the client was suit­ably impressed with the presentation and with my EM . my ED (my boss’s boss) was impressed with me . the most important person in your world is your boss . your boss may be the only person in your organization who can see you . making your boss look good means doing your job to the best of your ability . 68 Working to Solve Business Problems Second, make sure your boss knows everything you know when she needs to know it . don’t overload your boss with information . use a well-structured e-mail or voice mail to convey the information. if your boss looks good, you look good . assert your equality in the organization. keep on doing it until someone tells you otherwise . a newly hired associate fresh from a graduate degree in philosophy at Cambridge found himself assigned to an internal research project . Lowell had just finished the second chapter of a book on bank failures and asked the rest of the team for their comments . a week at the Firm, Hamish was showing the head of the finance practice exactly where he was being logically 69 Managing Hierarchy inconsistent and where his arguments were failing . Lowell was working out of town at the time, and Hamish faxed his comments directly to him, without showing them to his EM . in many firms, this would have been enough to get Hamish the sack . Lowell gave Hamish a copy inscribed with the message . he went on to have a very successful career at the Firm . it sounds extreme, but in a way, to be a successful consul tant, you have to assert yourself . a meritocratic organization at least can assert your equality until shown otherwise. this is a risky strategy, and the more hierarchical an organisation, the riskier it becomes . be more sensitive of where the limits to others’ authority lie . McKinsey problem-solving process begins with research . most of his time is spent collecting data, whether from one of the Firm’s libraries, or from the Internet . 71 72 working to solve business problems DON’T REINVENT THE WHEEL (PART 2) Whatever the problem, chances are that someone, somewhere, has worked on something similar . do your research and ask questions; you will save yourself a lot of time and effort . don’t waste it by reinventing the wheel! McKinsey keeps an electronic database called PDNet* . it contains reports from recent engagements and internal research . the database was created by a first-year associate . McKinsey has other resources that help consultants work smarter, not harder . it also has access to all major commercial databases such as the internet . the library has an electronic database of all PD (practice development) work done by the Firm . the firm disguises client names and data before storing anything on the system . the firm also has a cadre of senior information specialists who are experts in particular industries . our client, the financial arm of a very large computer hardware and software manufacturer, wanted advice on expanding internation ally. the client wanted to understand how major for eign conglomerates maintained financial and managerial control of their offshore subsidiaries . my engagement manager put me in charge of that part of the project . McKin­ sey team had recently put together an organizational profile of one of the most complex of my subjects, Daimler-Benz . the team was able to produce a document that impressed our client . if you work in a large organiza­tion you probably have access to much of your company’s “corpo­rate memory”—databases, files, training manuals, and coworkers . what about your local library? if you’re in advertising, find the café in your city where other ad execs hang out . learn from others’ successes and mistakes . SPECIFIC RESEARCH TIPS Use these tried-and-tested tips to jump-start your research . use these tips to make your research more efficient and effective . annual report is easy to obtain . turn first to the \"Message to Shareholders\" or \"Chairman’s Remarks\" at the front . 75 Doing Research management hopes to take the company in the future . you’ll get a quick break down of key financial indicators such as stock price, revenue, and earnings per share . look for outliers when you’ve collected a large amount of data on a particular aspect of your problem . use a computer to get a quick picture . enter the average sales of each salesperson and divide it by the number of accounts served by that salesperson for the last three years . look at the two or three best and worst figures . figure out why the numbers are so good or bad and you’ll be well on your way to fixing the problem . find out what the best performers are doing and imitate them . 76 Working to Solve Business Problems Sometimes you can find best practice within your company . figure out how to implement the top performer’s secrets throughout your organization . every engagement, someone on the team will conduct an interview . there is always someone who has information that the team needs: an executive at the client, a production-line supervisor, an industry expert, even a competitor. interviewing is the way consultants fill the gaps in their knowledge base . it is an important part of the problem-solving process that it merits its own chapter in this book . interviewing is a skill in its own right, and most people have no idea how to go about it . interviewing McKinsey style is of little use to execu­ tives in settled positions . 77 78 Working to Solve Business Problems a multifunctional team as part of a merger; you might be told to set up and run a new business . in this chapter, I will take you through the interviewing process . if you read no other chapter from start to finish, read this one . 79 Conducting Interviews BE PREPARED: WRITE AN INTERVIEW GUIDE . many people resent being interviewed, or at least begrudge you time that you are taking from their day . a guide is your best tool for getting what you want from interviewees . write them all down in any order . what do you really need from this interview? Defining your purpose will help you put your questions in the right order . it helps to know as much as possible about the interviewee in advance . an interview should start with general questions and move on to specific ones . 80 working to solve business problems This will help the interviewee “warm up” and allow you to develop rapport. ask a “ringer” will give you some insight into the interviewee’s honesty and/or knowledge . for complex issues, you may think you “know” the answer . you will try your hardest to get answers before leaving the interviewee's office . sometimes you won’t even get those answers, and sometimes they come easily . every interview guide should conclude with what I call the prototypical McKinsey question . ask the interviewee if there’s anything else he’d like to tell you or any question you forgot to ask . 81 Conducting interviews WHEN CONDUCTING INTERVIEWS, LISTEN AND GUIDE When you pick people’s brains, ask questions and then let them do the talking. McKinsey consultants receive a lot of training in interviewing tech niques . keep the interview on track by breaking in when necessary . uh-huh may not seem like much, but it shows that you’re paying attention . it gives the other person a chance to gather his thoughts and catch his breath. we learned to communicate our interest through body lan­ guage . when the interviewee was speaking, we leaned toward her slightly . note taking implied we were paying attention and kept us prepared . a conversation in Japanese is full of verbal placeholders such as hai (yes), un (a less polite form of yes) and desu ka (really?). the Japanese even have a word for this: aizuchi . the engagement manager answered in detail . he nodded and interjected with \"yes,\" \"uh-huh,\" and \"I see\" the EM thanked the executive for his time and the two consultants got up to leave . consultants are there to listen, not to talk . the process can sometimes prove difficult . a purchasing manager from a client’s plant in Idaho knew all about the plant’s suppliers, customers, input requirements, and manufacturing processes . use positive body lan­ guage and always take notes . if you want people to say more than they have, think they have left out something important . 83 Conducting Interviews have been giving you a prepared “script” . you have a goal to reach and limited time to reach it . the interviewee's boss tells him that the interview is impor­ tant . he’ll be less likely to jerk you around if he knows his boss wants him to talk to you . the approach is espe­cially effective when one of the interviewers has specific knowledge . it is always useful to have two different views of what actually happened in the interview . the way to get them 84 Working to Solve Business Problems is to listen . listen; listen; don’t lead . ask open-ended questions if you ask yes-or-no or multiple-choice questions . you think it is either sum­ mer or winter, but you’re not sure . if you ask the store manager, “is your busiest season summer or winter?” she might say summer, winter, or winter . you’ve just highlighted your lack of knowledge . every McKinsey consultant is trained to repeat back a sub-ject’s answers in slightly different form . she will give you the answer, and probably in more detail than if you gave her multiple choice . an EM had on his team a new associate, fresh out of the navy . he had on a team that had an associate . an indirect approach gives the interviewee a chance to add information . the EM let the interviewee take the lead, as 85 Conducting Interviews if it were an interrogation rather than an interview . the associate then grilled the manager aggressively to get exactly what he wanted . the moral of this tale is \"be sensitive to the interviewee’s feel­ ings\" understand that the person may feel threatened . don’t ask for too much . if you have to dance around the important issues, that’s OK . if you ask the interviewee for the sum total of his knowledge of the widget indus­try, you may find yourself wading through a lot of information to get what you really need . if you press too hard, you may find that the interviewee becomes uncooperative or even hos­tile . you never know when you may want to come back to the tactic . he quizzed a murder suspect about her whereabouts on the night in question . as he reached the threshold, he would turn around, stick his finger up to his temple . this question invariably gave Columbo the answer he needed to figure out who did it . the Columbo tactic is often a good way to get it . the interviewee will often tell you what you need or give you the information you need . interviewees are more likely to get the information you need . don't be afraid to ask questions about their job or business . if you have any questions, ask a question . a associate and his ED went to interview a middle-level manager at a pharmaceuticals company that the firm was helping to restructure . he had been with the company for 20 years; now he was terrified that he would get him fired . his hands were 87 Conducting Interviews shaking too much . he put the pot down and tried again to get the coffee out . interviewer: you have a professional responsibility to respect the inter-viewee's anxiety . he says you have the responsibility to allay it, not to take advantage of it . respecting the interviewee's anxiety means not leaving him feeling naked at the end of the interview . be circumspect about asking questions that may touch on deeply personal matters from the inter-viewee’s perspective . if you make their job more efficient, that should benefit them . don’t be afraid to offer a quid pro quo too . 88 Working to Solve Business Problems There is no need to flash your authority like a police badge . most of the time, an interviewee is willing to help . if you run into real obstruction or hostility, you may have to bring your authority into play . others will test your strength and spirit, once you know how to handle them . the stakes for the company and its executives were high; the prospect of mass firings loomed . the var­ious players in the organization square off into pro- and anti-McKinsey camps . if you aggressively pursue solutions to business problems, you will run into a situation like Hamish’s . how do you handle this kind of outright hostility in an inter­viewee? 89 conducting interviews Hamish did it because he was a difficult guy . if someone says something blatantly false like that, you have to challenge him . the limits to this strategy are the limits of your authority in the organization . McKinsey consultants usually have the back­ing of the top management at the client . inter­viewees refuse to answer your question or give you access to relevant documents or data . if the per­ son you are interviewing is more senior than the person who authorized your project, you will probably have to back down when challenged . if you’re there asking them questions, then someone in your organization wants you to be there . if necessary, call the boss on the phone there and then . psy­ chiatrists interview a woman who told her that she could give me half an hour . a former EM found out that she had blocked out an hour for the interview . she told me that she couldn't give me a half-hour . handling a Sandbagger requires an indirect approach . the most useful strategy is finding someone else in the organization who can tell you what you want to know. the last category of difficult interview is also the hardest to handle . being face to face with someone who knows your work will likely get him fired . there is very little you can do in such cases apart from playing the good soldier . you have to do your job and get the interviewee to help you . no one ever said life was fair . 91 Conducting Interviews ALW AYS WRITE A THANK-YOU NOTE When you get back to your office after interviewing some­ one, take the time to write a thank-you letter . it’s polite and professional, and could pay you back in unexpected ways . after holidays and birth days, I spent weeks writing letters thanking aunts and uncles and cousins . my mom would always be after me, making sure I wrote those notes . my mom taught me to avoid boilerplate thank-you notes . sending someone a few choice words below your corporate letterhead puts your company in a favorable light . 92 Working to Solve Business Problems is worth it . it takes a few extra seconds to write a thank-you note . every new McKinsey-ite hears the story of the associate who needs to interview a senior sales executive at an agricultural products company somewhere in America's heartland . when he calls the man saying he’s from McKiney and would like an hour of his time, he receives an effusive welcome from the other end of the line. a letter thanking the executive for his time on a day 15 years in the past . the letter has pride of place on the man's office wall, along with his college diploma . the study has been sold, the team assembled, and the preliminary research done, the real work can begin . most large, modern cor­ porations are chock full of intelligent, knowledgeable man­agers . McKinsey offers a new mindset, an outsider’s view that is not locked into “the company way” of doing things . it starts in a meeting room with a table, chairs, a bunch of pads, pens and pencils, some markers, and a clean white board . the ED, the EM, and possibly the more senior associates on the team come up with initial hypotheses that the team will then test to destruction . some team leaders prefer weekends for meetings, though this is not always looked on favorably by the other members of the team . these sessions run well into the Copyright 1999 Ethan M. Rasiel . 93 94 Working to Solve Business Problems night, fueled by deliveries of pizza, Chinese food, or sushi . brainstorming is playing with the old puzzle Rubik’s Cube . each fact is a face on one of the small cubes . the same thing happens when you toss around facts and ideas . straights, flushes, full houses, and straights are all in order . we’ll take a closer look at the var­ious aspects of brainstorming à la McKinsey . learn a few tips to make your brainstorming more productive . there is a method to prepar­ing for your brainstorming session . don’t just stride into the meeting expecting to wow everyone with your brilliance . if you are the leader, make sure that all your team members put their research into fact packs . make sure everyone on the team knows what you know . McKinsey-ites fall into two camps on this subject . the first group says, \"Familiarize yourself with the outlines of the problem and the data\" the counterproposition states, \"Always come in with a 96 Working to Solve Business Problems hypothesis; otherwise, you waste too much time flailing around looking for ideas\" if you’re the team leader, you probably ought to have one. don’t march into the team room saying, “This is the answer.” The right attitude is, “let’s attack this hypothesis as a group.” you can quickly dismiss hypotheses that are unrealistic, while giving your team free rein to work on ideas that are more plausible . remember the Boy Scout motto: \"Be prepared\" tabula rasa: leave your preconceptions at the door . brainstorm­97 Brainstorming ing is a clean slate . if you get your team into the room, don't forget the facts . brainstorming benefits from a few contradic-tions . if all the team members come into the room saying the same old things, then you’ve gained nothing and wasted time . no guarantee on any given day that the former will have better ideas than the latter . no one should be afraid to speak his mind in the brainstorming room . the SEM called the team members in for a brainstorming ses­ sion . they then sat there for the next hour watching him think to himself . brainstorming is part of the brainstorming process . there are no bad ideas . no one should ever hesitate to open her mouth during a brainstorming session . ideas that are not 98 working to Solve Business Problems directed at the problem at hand don' t count . there are no dumb questions . often the answer is \"Well, gee, that’s the way we’ve always done it\" never discount the benefits of working through seemingly obvious or simple questions . we spent 45 minutes thinking through the dynamics of international money management . be prepared to kill your babies . this rather shocking notion originated among Hollywood screenwriters . if your idea is not part of the team’s answer at the end of the session, dispense with it . offer it up to your teammates and let them knock it around . the consensus among former McKinsey-ites is that a team can stand about two hours of brainstorming before the atmosphere deteriorates . this time frame is especially true of evening sessions . unless the team is composed completely of night 99 Brainstorming owls, people become tired, cranky, and slow off the mark as the night wears on . sometimes you get on a roll and the adrenaline keeps you productive until well past midnight . if you must hold an all-day session, you have to make allowances to keep the participants’ energy level up . let conver­sations go on tangents; allow people to make jokes and let off steam, but rein them in after a little while to keep them focused . brainstorming doesn’t lend itself to precise note taking . you can, under any circumstances, leave the room and turn off the lights without a record of the outcome . McKinsey uses an excellent device to preserve the outcomes of brainstorming sessions . almost every meeting room has a white board and markers that wipe clean with an eraser or paper towel . flipcharts are a marker ink on 100 Working to Solve Business Problems paper . the key to successful brainstorming is good preparation and a proper frame of mind . here are some tricks that McKinsey-ites use to get the maximum benefit from their brainstorming sessions . Kristin Asleson took part in an experi­mental training program on brainstorming . give everyone in the room a pad of sticky notes and hand them over to the leader . flipcharts are a good way to generate ideas quickly without getting bogged down . each team member goes around the room writing ideas down on the appropriate flipcharter . Kristin recalls a particularly effec­ tive method for handling large-scale brainstorming meetings in a tense atmosphere . we asked players to tell us up front everything they didn’t like about the program we had presented . the tech­nique worked in two ways: it yielded some excellent ideas that we would not have otherwise come up with . it helped a previously skeptical, if not outright hostile, team buy into McKinsey’s solution . if he mutters an aside, the moderator can ask him to speak up . try these exercises to jazz up your brainstorming sessions .

Click here for Terms of Use . the best solution, no matter how well researched, how thoroughly analyzed, how glitteringly, flawlessly structured, is worth exactly nothing if your clients don’t buy into it . you’ll learn how to put together a presentation that conveys your ideas to your audience . you’ll learn how to manage internal communications so everyone on your team can stay “on message” . how to work with and manage your client organizations and the people who work in them . meetings held around boardroom tables with neatly bound blue books . informal presentations between a few managers at the client and a couple of McKinsey consultants . 105 106 Selling Solutions BE STRUCTURED For your presentation to succeed, it must take the audience down the path of your logic in clear, easy steps . we went over the structure of the McKinsey problem-solving process at great length in part one of this book . a presentation reflects the thinking of the person or team that put it together . whatever structure you applied to your thought process, apply it to your presenta­tion . if you use the McKinsey structure, use it in your presentation . a friend of mine at business school became an entrepreneur . he was capable of brilliant insights and intuitive leaps . but his thinking was not particularly organized . if you adhere to a structure that makes a step-by-step progression, you want the audience to follow your presentation at your pace . there’s usually someone in the audience who lacks 107 Making Presentations the patience for this. one EM faced the problem of a senior manager at his client . he handed the manager a blue book with all the pages stapled together . but the EM found a solution . REMEMBER THAT THERE ARE DIMINISHING MARGINAL RETURNS TO EFFORT Resist temptation to tweak your presentation right up to the last minute . don’t let the best be the enemy of the good . one of the most common and most unnecessary experiences shared by almost every associate in the Firm is the 4 a.m. vigil in the copier room waiting for the presentation booklets to be put together for tomorrow’s big progress review. one associate and his EM worked through the night cutting and pasting new numbers onto a chart with razor blades and a glue stick . in many cases, this is laudable: No 108 Selling Solutions one wants to ride in an airplane where the engine mounting bolts fit almost correctly. don’t let the best be the enemy of the good when you are preparing a presenta­ tion . learn to recognize that point and draw the line on changes well in advance of the meeting . every document of any length will have a few typos . on rare occa­sions, that typo may have to be corrected . giving a presentation is stressful enough as it is . tell yourself and your team that you want the documents printed, copied, bound, or transferred onto slides . spend the time between then and the presentation rehearsing, discussing possible questions that may arise . if someone senior to you (e.g., your ED) has the final say on the document, then you have to manage upward as strongly as you can . be firm in telling your boss that she must sign off in time for you to meet your 24-hour dead­line . 109 Making Presentations PREWIRE EVERYTHING A good business presentation should contain nothing new for the audience . walk all the players at the client through your findings before you gather them into one room . your boss is here; the heads of all your company’s busi­ness units are here . your CEO is sitting at the head of the table hanging on your every word . the director of the gadgets divi­sion is incensed . he says the future of the company lies with gadgets. CFO protests that the company doesn't have that level of funds available . the president of the widgets subsidiary rushes to your defense . former EM said it was very rare for us to do a presentation where we hadn’t taken the 110 Selling Solutions various players through our findings beforehand. Otherwise, it was just too risky. you must remember the cardinal rule of being a successful consultant or corporate troubleshooter . sometimes, this just requires sales manship; sometimes it takes compromise . Suppose you walk into the office of Bob, the director of the Gadgets division, and tell him that you think the answer is to invest more in widgets, at the expense of gadgets . when you are alone with him in his office, you are far more likely to be able to take him through your analysis step by step . if the compromise is small, make it and move on . if his demands are too great, you will have to fig­ure out a way to bypass him . if he throws you out of his office (unlikely, but possible), you have a problem on your hands . imagine that you have prewired your presenta­tion with all the senior managers at the table . the direc­111 Making Presentations tor of gadgets says the future of our company requires us to increase our investment in widget production by 75 percent over the next two years . the CFO raises an eyebrow, but says nothing—you’ve already shown him how he can fund the additional investment . the SVP of the widget subsidiary, secure in the knowledge that she will be the winner at the end of today’s presentation, merely looks in the direction of the CEO . 11 DISPLAYING DATA WITH CHARTS AT McKinsey relies on charts, graphical representations of infor­ mation . the firm has devoted a lot of time and effort to dis­ cover what works with charts and what does not . Gene Zelazny, the Firm’s guru of charts and presentations, has written a book titled Say It With Charts . it is an excellent resource and I don’t intend to repeat its contents here . the more complex a chart becomes, the less effective it is at conveying information . use charts as a means of getting your message across, not as an art project . when I started at the Firm, the first pieces of equipment I was issued were a box of mechanical pencils, an eraser, and a set of ruled, plastic templates with cutouts for various shapes . in 1989, hardly the Stone Age, I had been using computer graphics to draw charts . it struck me as slightly primitive: evidence of a corporate culture that was inflexible in the face of advancing technology . the firm uses charts as a means of expressing information in a readily under­standable form . the simpler things are, the easier they are to understand . McKinsey prints its charts in black and white . it adheres to the cardinal rule of one message per chart . the first two strictures are visual . McKinsey consultants do this with the “lead,” the caption at the top of the chart . a good lead expresses the point in one simple sentence . if a chart offers several insights, copy it with a new lead and the relevant information highlighted (see Figure 11-2). look in the lower left corner of either chart . you ACME Widgets ran an operating loss last year ACME WIDGET CORPORATION INCOME STATEMENT 1998 ($US Millions) 150 –170 Net Wigget Gain on Taxes Net Income Sales Sale of –20 18 10 –2 6 Operating Expenses Earnings Before Interest Income Gadget . 116 Selling Solutions We would have posted a loss in 1998 without the sale of our gadgets divison ACME WIDGET CORPORATION INCOME STATEMENT 1998 ($US Millions) 150 –170 Net Widget Gain on Taxes Net Income Sales Sale of –20 18 10 –2 6 Operating Expenses Earnings Before Interest Income Gadgets Subsidiary Interest (Net) and taxes Source: too many charts will bore your audience's audi­ ence . use the absolute minimum necessary to make your point, or you may find that your audience hasn’t absorbed the last 10 to 15 pages of your presentation. 117 Displaying Data with Charts USE A W ATERFALL CHART TO SHOW THE FLOW The waterfall chart is an excellent way to illustrate quantitative flows . it looked like a column chart, but not like any you’d find in the chart libraries of ExcelTM, FreelanceTM, or any of the other popular computer graphics packages . it’s called a waterfall chart, and McKinsey-ites use it all the time . the waterfall chart is an excellent method of illustrating how you get from number A to number B . former McKinsey-ites shared their lessons about waterfall charts . the charts in Figures 11-1 and 11-2 depict a simplified income statement, starting with sales on the left and ending with net income on the right . the starting point is always a column that begins at zero . the 118 Selling Solutions total is the distance from the top of the last item (or bottom if that item is negative) to the zero line . subtotals can be included along the way in the same manner . the waterfall chart is a versatile way to convey a lot of information in a clear, concise manner . you can segregate negative and positive items to show, say, where value is created and where it is destroyed . McKinsey has the same methods of internal communica­tion as those available to any modern organization . it is fair to say that the Firm as a whole has no new insights to offer . 119 120 Selling Solutions KEEP THE INFORMATION FLOWING Information is to your team what gasoline is to a car’s engine . if you choke off the flow, you’ll stall . the Mushroom Method of management is unpro­ductive . it is possible to keep your boss in the dark, cover them with manure, and see what crops up . make sure your team is up to date with at least the broad out­ lines of your project . being “in the loop” will help your teammates understand how their work is contributing to the final goal . always keep your boss up to date with your team's progress . keep her in the dark when she knows everything is under control . the 121 Managing internal communications message (whether in the form of voice mail, e-mail, or memo) and the meeting . meetings form the glue that holds your team together . meetings allow excellent information flow, in all directions, and provide a certain amount of social bonding . to ensure that people do show up, make team meet­ings a regular item on everyone’s schedule . if you have nothing to discuss, then cancel the meeting . keep the number of items on your agenda to the minimum needed to make sure everyone is up to date . if you are the leader, make sure you cover your agenda as briskly as possible . one method of internal communication is in a class by itself . you can gain a lot by wandering around and talking to people . make sure that you do so frequently and openly . you will boost your team’s efficiency and morale . 122 Selling Solutions THE THREE KEYS TO A EFFECTIVE MESSAGE A good business message has three attributes: brevity, thor­oughness and structure . include all three in every voice mail, e-mail or memo you send and you get your message across . an effective message shares the same properties as an effec­tive presentation . it is brief, covering only the points the audience needs to know . the lack of it is much more of a problem in spoken than written communications . some McKinsey-ites write the entire message out like a script before sending a voice mail . make sure your message contains everything your audience needs to know . 123 Managing internal communications 3. Structure . tell your boss what you are doing, what the issues are and what your thoughts are on them . a message must fol­ low a structure, and that structure must be readily apparent to the audience . a simple structure can be as basic as this: 1. our widgets are too expensive . 2. Our sales force is incompetent . McKinsey-ites can take structuring their messages a bit too far . one EM in the office put her shopping lists in Firm format . another left affectionate messages on his wife's answering machine . the EM leading the discussion 124 Selling Solutions mentioned that when he stayed over at his girlfriend’s apartment, he kept his briefcase locked . if you can’t trust your girlfriend, whom can you trust? . it was only after I had been at the Firm a bit longer . if we were on a plane, we didn’t take client information out of our briefcases . we never mentioned our clients by name outside the office, and sometimes not even at the Firm . a EM from germany recalled coming home to find a note from his girlfriend . he said the dinner would take place at a fancy Munich restaurant . the EM had used the client’s real name, although luckily he had been misunderstood. if you’re working on something sensitive, take a few basic pre­ cautions . don’t leave important papers lying around . you can tell your significant other only if he or she doesn’t pose a security risk . don’ t talk about the specifics of your work outside your team . this page intentionally left blank . 13 WORKING WITH CLIENTs ABOUT WORKing WITH TEAMS . without clients there would be no McKinsey . Hamish McDermott remarked that there was one true hierarchy at McKinsey . in this chapter, we will cover the two different aspects of working with clients . we will start with techniques to get the most out of a client team . we will then move on to managing the client . you will learn how to keep your clients engaged and supportive of your efforts . when will you actually have to deal with client teams? 127 128 Selling Solutions is a joint venture with a team from an entirely different organization . the discussion of client teams will be useful as the discussions of managing your client . 129 working with clients KEEP THE CLIENT TEAM ON YOUR SIDE . make sure that members of the client team understand why their efforts are important to you and beneficial for them . the key to keeping the client teams on our side was to turn their goals into our goals . members of the client team must realize that working with McKinsey will be a positive experience for them . orga-nization is a rare experience in most people’s working lives . they must be made to understand that, at a minimum, they’ll learn things that they would never otherwise know . Morty, a mainframe computer programmer, lived with his parents in Brooklyn . he wore thick glasses and a suit that never quite fit . he got to meet senior people in his organization: bankers, brokers and 130 Selling Solutions traders . he learned how to apply his own skills to solve problems he would not normally see in his day-to-day work . working with Morty was an eye-opener for Morty . he loved it, and that job was left to me . team-bonding activities really add value when working with client teams . the client team is not bound by the same shared experiences as the team . a trip to the ballpark or dinner at a good restaurant can help the members of each team realize that the others are real people too . \"liability\" members off the client team if you can; otherwise, work around them . ideally, neither type is on your team . 131 working with clients on an engagement for a large new Y ork bank . he worked with a client team staffed with senior managers from var­ ious departments within the client organization . Hank knew his area of the bank inside and out and was probably as smart as any member of the McKinsey team . he thought that the Firm peddled an expensive line of baloney to credulous clients . as a first (and easiest) tactic, you can try to trade the liability out of your team and get somebody better . trading doesn’t always work; there might be no one better available and you’re stuck with your own Hank . Hank was a superslick operator from Argentina . he was the leader of the client team and our main liaison with the most senior management at the client . car­132 Selling Solutions los had the patronage of a board-level faction . they felt they knew which direction McKinsey would recommend . he sent us down blind alleys; he badmouthed us to the board behind our backs . the best tactic is to trade the saboteur out of your team . if you have a Carlos on board, it’s because someone powerful in the orga­ nization wants him there . we had to leave Carlos to our ED, who had the political skill and muscle to handle him . sometimes, you can even polish the rough diamonds . 133 working with clients ENGAGE THE CLIENT IN THE PROCESS If the client doesn’t support you, your project will stall . keep your clients engaged by keeping them involved . to succeed as a management consultant or a business trou­ bleshooter you must keep your client engaged in the problem-solving process . being engaged means supporting your efforts, providing resources as needed, and caring about the outcome . the first step in keeping your clients engaged is to understand their agenda . keep in touch with your clients and keep your projects “top of mind” for them . schedule progress meetings with tenta­tive topics; if you need to reschedule, do it later. early “wins” will generate enthusiasm for your project . they give your clients something to sink their teeth into and make them feel included in the problem-solving process. 134 Selling Solutions outside consultant, you will never get credit for your best work . Suzanne Tosini developed a huge cashflow model that the client was going to use to evaluate acquisitions . the client team members got up and talked about the model that they developed . it was not McKinsey's model, it was Suzanne’s model . GET BUY -IN THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION If your solution is to have a lasting impact on your client, you have to get support for it at all levels of the organization . if you want to create real change that has lasting impact, you must get accep­135 Working with Clients tance for your solution from everyone in the organization that it affects . the board ratifies your suggestion; champagne corks pop and cigars ignite . to avoid this dire fate, you must sell your solution to every level of the organization, from the board on down . present to middle-level managers . serial presentations give the junior members of your team a good opportunity to hone their presentation skills . don’t neglect the people on the line, so let them know what’s going on . don’t make the same presentation to, say, the fleet drivers as you would to the CEO . show people the entire picture. Let them know how their jobs fit into the organization as a whole . 136 Selling Solutions BE RIGOROUS ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION Making change happen takes a lot of work . make sure someone takes responsibility for getting the job done . your implementation plan should be specific about what will happen and when . hold training sessions for all sales regions . take new sales teams to call on top 20 customers . former EM gave a no-holds-barred recipe for a successful implementation plan . make specific people responsible for implementing the solu­tion . be careful about who you pick . the right person can make implementation a very smooth process . if that person is not going to be you, make sure you pick someone who can \"kick butt and take names\" he assigned specific tasks to members of his team . every two weeks the team would meet, and anyone who had not accomplished his or her tasks had to explain the failure to the entire group . this page intentionally left blank . you will learn a few tricks for surviving in any high-pressure organi­ zation . if you’re trying to maintain your sanity while traveling for weeks at a time, try to climb the greasy pole to success in your organization or just have a life while working 100 hours per week, there’s something in Part Four that will help . 141 142 Surviving at McKinsey As Tarzan once remarked, it’s a jungle out there . find someone senior in your organisation to be your mentor . McKinsey maintains a comprehensive system of mentoring for its client service staff . every consultant, from analyst to director, is assigned a mentor to monitor and guide his or her career through the Firm. as an MBA, I was considering whether to join McKinsey's office . he bought me lunch at a trendy Italian eatery where supermodels popped in to nibble on arugula leaves . we talked about working at the Firm and how best to climb its greasy pole to success . within about six months, he transferred to Mexico to open a new office south of the border . adrift in the Sea of McKinsey without a guide? I hitched my wagon to a star . I did most of my work with one ED who recruited me into the Firm . 143 Find Your Own Mentor We had a good relationship . he tried to get me assigned to his teams on studies where I had expertise . how much you benefited from your official mentor was pretty much a matter of luck . find someone senior to you whose abilities and opinion you respect . seek out the mentor’s advice . many people like to give advice and are happy to dispense it when asked . work with the mentor, if possible, and learn all you can . don’t go to the well too often, however; you don't want to become a pest . making travel an adventure will lighten your load . 145 146 Surviving at McKinsey The working condi­tions can be grueling . many McKinsey consultants spend most of their time on the road, away from home, family, and friends . work out of town adds to the grind . commuting 1000 miles every Monday morning (or Sunday night) to a far-flung client . a former EM noted that there is nothing so mind-numbing as the \"If it’s Tuesday, this must be Davenport\" cross-country trips a consultant has to make when visiting all of a manufactur­ing company’s many plants across America . McKinsey-ites have developed a number of ways to cope with the rigors of travel . they all agree on the importance of maintaining a proper attitude . Jason Klein spent only one night away from home while working for clients . most of my clients were new york–based financial firms, so my commute meant getting on the subway to wall Street . 147 Surviving on the Road take an afternoon and play Pebble Beach . y ou can keep your nose to the grindstone for only so long . travel is an opportunity to do things outside your normal realm of experience . Abe Bleiberg once worked on a project where people sat around a table trying to market toilet paper . it’s not something I’d want to dedicate my life to, but that’s part of the fun of working at the Firm . if pos­ sible, schedule your time at the client to make sure you are at home on Fridays or Mondays . fly with hand luggage; don’t assume the air­line will let you take that extra carry-on bag. find out if the hotel has a room where you can store your extra bags when you leave for the weekend . find a reliable cab company . don’t let the travel and the work become all-consuming, espe­cially . find a way to enter­tain yourself outside of work . find colleagues, client team members, or old friends from business school or college to 148 Surviving at McKinsey . when you get back to the hotel do something before you go to sleep . don’t let being on the road become an uninterrupted cycle of working, eating and sleeping . security first network bank president says he treats everyone with respect . some of my colleagues were amazed at how I would get upgraded, or would get a bag on after the plane was full . 16 TAKE THESE THREE THINGS WITH YOU WHEREVER YOU GO Narrow your travel needs down to the very few things you must have with you when you leave . 149 150 Surviving at McKinsey Anybody who travels frequently knows the three things you always take with you when trav­ eling abroad . a copy of my itinerary, a list of the names and numbers of everyone I’m going to see, and a good book. former McKinsey-ites interviewed what three things they always have with them when they travel . here are some of the answers grouped by category and explanatory notes . a cashmere sweater for keeping warm and comfy on overnight flights . an extra shirt or blouse for the men and a pair of flat shoes for the women . the prize for the oddest answer has to go to a former McKin- sey-ite from the Düsseldorf office who listed Coca-Cola . the prize for the best three items goes to a former associate in the Washington, DC office . the prize goes to an associate who justifiably wishes to remain anonymous . our hero spent much of his time consulting in Brazil, where the weather is unpredictable . 17 A GOOD ASSISTANT IS A LIFELINE Call the position secretary, administrative assistant, or whatever . 153 154 Surviving at McKinsey In the new york office, the competition to hire good sec retaries is as intense as that for top MBA graduates . the firm provides a real career path for secre­ taries . new recruits usually start out working with four or five asso­ciates . many of the managers running the Firm started out as secre­taries . now they have positions of considerable power and responsi­bility . a good secretary will perform numerous tasks that make a McKinsey consultant’s life easier . these range from the obvious to the not-so-obvious . most McKinsey-ites can do their own typing, many handle their own filing . niggling little things that you would normally do if you were not 500 miles from your apartment for the next six months . a number of associates whose lives were a living hell were lost because their secretaries were not up to scratch . faxes misdirected; messages appeared 155 A Good Assistant Is a Lifeline days after they were taken . one consultant had her cover blown when her secretary told boyfriend num­ ber 1 that she was at a lunch date with boyfriend number 2 . her secretary, who was keeping two boyfriends in ignorance of each other, told her she was in Houston all week . she always came through for me . I always gave her top marks in her evaluations . this made me nervous, because I was afraid a partner would poach her . it meant giving her the respect she deserved in her job . I let her know where I was at all times during the day, so that she could reach me with important news or let clients and other consultants get in contact with me . this made ours a relationship from which we both benefited . the principle remains: treat them well, be clear about what you want, and give them room to grow . a temp will never rise in the corporate ranks, but you will get better work out of him . the junior team member will benefit immensely from a bit of careful nurturing . answer her questions and showing her the ropes will benefit you too . this page intentionally left blank . 157 158 Surviving at McKinsey . the first stage in reaching that goal is recruiting the best possible candidates to join the Firm . the Firm takes recruiting so seriously, it commits seri­ous resources to it . every top business school has its own team of consultants assigned to it, complete with its own charge code for expenses . the EM on the team makes recruiting a full-time commitment . at McKinsey’s hourly rate, that represents a very large opportunity cost . Kristin Asleson took a highly courted JD-MBA out to lunch in new york . she took her to le Cirque, where she held court at a rear corner table . cases are the weapon of choice in a McKinsey interview . they range from the prosaic to the whimsical or even weird . the interviewer wants to see how well the interviewee can think about a problem, rather than how correctly she answers it . succeeding in a case interview requires breaking the problem into its component pieces . the average household size (including singles) yields 110 million households . the reviewer nods in agreement with the calcu­lator** . the average household has 1.8 cars (or was that children?) so the united states must have 198 million cars . one of my interviewers posed this challenge: \"you’ve just been appointed special assistant to the Mayor of New York City. he wants to know how to make New York a better place. 160 Surviving at McKinsey many gas stations it takes to serve 198 million cars . what matters is not the numbers, but the method you use to reach them . interviewer abe Bleiberg said that most of the people who made it into the inter­view process were smart enough to work at the Firm . the interviewer must get beyond the résumé and penetrate the polish . a candidate’s fit with the Firm can be tough . Hamish McDermott met with one would-be McKinsey-ite from Harvard Business School . he gave a very structured, prepared, and long spiel listing all his strengths, virtues, and life experiences . Harvard Man did not get an offer to join the Firm . many of you want to know how to get a job at McKinsey . be of above average intelligence, possess a record of academic achievement at a good college and a top business school, demonstrate extraordinary analytical ability . the key to your joining the Firm may be the case interview . I always asked the same case, but wanted to see how people dealt with a com­plex problem . some people froze; others just dug deeper and deeper . if you work 80 hours or more per week, there’s not much time left over for anything else . 163 164 Surviving at McKinsey One especially bittersweet memory comes from a study I did for a Wall Street investment bank . many former McKinsey-ites replied that they didn't do a good job of it . one of them told me, \"i didn’t make enough rules. I didn’m not a big fan of it\" hours of discussion with former McKinsey-ites have yielded three rules for a better life while at the Firm . make one day a week off-limits and tell your boss that you never work on that day unless it’s an absolute emergency . if you need to stay at the office for another hour, that’s better than coming home and ignoring your kids because you still have work to do . make sure that you respect it too . 165 If You Want a Life, Lay Down Some Rules of mind . if you want to do anything more than curl up with a good book, then you have to arrange things in advance . rules offer the great advantage of letting everyone know what to expect . when your priorities are “client, Firm, you,” some­ times you have to let your life take a backseat to your career . former McKinsey-ite says leaving the Firm is never a question of when . half of new associates will have left the Firm by the end of that time . the vast majority of former McKinsey-ites land on their feet . a quick scan through the alumni directory reveals any number of CEOs, CFOs, senior managers, professors, politicians . the Firm has left its mark on them as much as they left their marks on their clients . in this last few pages, I want to share some of those memories with you . the first goal was to trans­mit some of the skills and techniques that make them successful at what they do . the second was to convey to the outsider some idea of what it’s like to work at McKinsey . life after McKinsey 169 answers to a question . some of the answers involve material you’ve already seen in this book . others describe lessons that cannot be taught—only learned. a baker’s dozen of former McKinsey-ites learned lessons from the WSJ . if you are comfortable with reading about your actions on the front page, then it’s OK. putting the client first is the key to successful client service . to do so, you must maintain your professional objectivity . it has allowed me to stand my ground when a client hasn’t heard what he wants to hear . the most valuable lesson I learned was humility, humility and humility . the firm’s clients had a hard time doing either one when trying major change . the firm taught me that every problem has a solution; it may not be perfect, but it will allow me to take actions that are directionally correct . it has to do with problem solv-ing, the idea that any problem can be broken into its constituents and solved . no stars, just meritocracy . the culture is extremely strong within the Firm, and I think it can work in other organizations too . a blue book is just a book, unless you do something with it . former EM in the new york office learned to value strongly honesty and integrity in busi-ness . this is something McKinsey inculcates in its people and insists upon . former associate in the new york office 173 The most V aluable Lesson You may be asking yourself, with some justification, what my most valuable lesson was . fizzy thinking, obfusca­tory jargon, impenetrable hierarchy get in the way of adding value for customers or clients . structured thinking, clear language, a meritocracy with the obligation to dissent, and professional objectivity allow an organization and its people to reach their maximum potential poten­tial . former McKinsey-ites leave their alumni with vivid mem­ ories . here is a sampling of what they remember most about the Firm . McKinsey alumni took away many memories, but the strongest memories had to do with the people that make the Firm what it is . what stays with me is the rigorous standard of information and analysis, the proving and double-proving of every rec­ommendation, combined with the high standard of commu­ nication . former associate in the Boston and new york offices . there’s an attitude within the Firm that says, \"if there’ is a problem, give us the resources and we’ll solve it\" you often run into the attitude that says, “It can’t be done” at McKinsey . click here for Terms of Use . life after McKinsey: \"i enjoyed the power of thinking in a small group of very smart people\" he was a vice president at goldman Sachs Structure, structure, structure . the people McKinsey recruits and retains throughout the organization . on average, they are smart and fun to be with . former EM in the new york office The average mental capacity of the staff, whether it be the newest associate or the most senior director, and the approachabil­ity of people within the Firm, regardless of hierarchy . the thing I miss most about McKinsey is the canteen . the average-caliber employee is far below McKinsey’s least intelligent . wesley Sand The people, the wide range of people one came in contact with, both at the Firm and at the clients. suzanne tosini is an author of the book . the book is based on my experiences and those of former McKinsey-ites . the great rabbi called the Gentile impudent and chased him away . Rabbi Hillel motioned the man to stand one-legged . the 178 Life After McKinsey rabbi' s study . Hillel told him, \"Do unto others as you would have others do unto you. The rest derives from that. Go and learn\" the rest derives from that. Go and learn . this page intentionally left blank . click here for Terms of Use.
